Financial Security using Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection. The project tries to predict credit-card frauds using Machine Learning as it is believed to provide better results as compared to the existing techniques used to detect these frauds. It becomes challenging due to two major reasons â€“ first, the profiles of normal and fraudulent behavior change frequently and second, the credit card fraud data sets are highly skewed. The performance is checked by implementation of Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression. The best machine learning model is deployed according to our accuracy results to a website and show its actual working with the test data set.
